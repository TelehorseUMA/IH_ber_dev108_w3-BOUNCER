BOUNCER

Bouncer is a simple game inspired by Berlin nightlife and vintage arcade game Tapper. It utilizes Javascript, CSS, HTML and canvas.

Players take the role of the bouncer of a nightclub and have to admit or turn away guests advancing in line. They are responsible for upholding the club's reputation while at the same time keeping revenue flowing. Admitting guests gains players cash, reputation however can only be maintained if undesirable guests are turned away. The game is lost, if reputation falls below a certain level or one of the lines remains filled up for too long.
