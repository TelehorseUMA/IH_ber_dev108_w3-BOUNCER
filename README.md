BOUNCER

Bouncer is a simple game inspired by Berlin nightlife and vintage arcade game Tapper. It utilizes Javascript, CSS, HTML and canvas.

The user plays the bouncer of a nightclubber and has to decide which of the guests advancing in line to admit into the club and which to turn away. By admitting desirable guests the player gains reputation and cash. Admitting undesirable guests diminishes the player's reputation. The player loses the game, if reputation falls below a certain level or one of the lines remains completely filled up for too long.
